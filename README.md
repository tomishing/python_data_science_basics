# Python Code for Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning

This repository contains a series of practice exercises created during my journey of learning machine learning and practical statistical analysis using Python.

To be honest, I’ve primarily used R for statistical analysis, and I still believe R has an edge over Python in that area—especially in ecological research, where a wide range of well-developed packages are readily available.

That said, I’m excited to be gaining hands-on experience with Python, and I look forward to understanding the strengths and limitations of both tools by the end of this journey.
